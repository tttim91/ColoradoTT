		          	<h1> About Tim </h1>
		          	<p> Hello!  My name is Tim Musgrove - creator of Coloradott! I currently live in Denver, CO, USA and am studying to become a professional web developer.  This website happens to be my first project and I hope to use it as a medium for practicing new web development skills that I learn.  Before embarking on the journey though, I worked as a petroleum engineer for multiple international oil companies.  During that time, I learned so much about myself, about problem solving and about new technologies. While I really enjoyed my time as an engineer, with the oil industry currently in a very bad place, I decided to utilize my problem solving abilities within the digital world.  A little more personally some of my favorite things to learn about are math, science and coding.  All of these subjects capture useful information about the world and can be used to figure out how to make things better.  Along with studying these, I love to play table tennis as should be obvious by the nature of this website.  I have been playing table tennis for many years now and have even served as a private coach, group coach and operations manager at two Colorado table tennis clubs.  I am currently training to be the best player in the state while keeping my main focus on my new career.  Another interesting thing about me is that before college I lived around the world including Indonesia (6 yrs), Qatar (6 yrs), England (5 yrs) and Abu Dhabi, UAE.  I had a great time exploring other cultures and meeting people around the world.  I think it gives me a big advantage in that I am very flexible in the way that I work and live.  I am willing to do anything as long as it is useful for me or the client.  Take a look at some of the other pages on this site for some interesting content.  There is another page (<a href="Coding.html">Coding Goals</a>) that you can go to in order to find out more about me and the goals I have for school and for web development in general! </p>
