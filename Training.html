		        	<!--<h3> 2/20/2016 - Dedicated Practice</h3>-->
		          	<p> Coming soon!<!--Welcome to the first in what I hope to be a long series of tips for aspiring table tennis players! This series is dedicated to providing useful training tips to people who want to be great table tennis players. One of the things that makes table tennis (or ping-pong) great is that it is so easy to get started playing. All you need is a table (local sports store or friend's basement), a ball and two paddles. If you are someone who wants to have a bit of fun playing the game/sport of table tennis then get started and I am sure you will have alot of fun. If you are interested in getting serious though, challenging your brain and body and getting better at one of the best sports ever created then keep reading as this series will provide you all the tips you need to become a great player. </p>
		          	<p>The first thing I want to talk about is a concept called &quot;dedicated practice.&quot; Dedicated practice is different than what most people would consider practice in that if you follow certain rules while you practice you will be dedicating yourself to getting better every time you play. Dedicated practice is what is necessary to get better at any sport, game or endeavor. There are many sources claiming that 10,000 hours of dedicated practice in a certain activity is all you need to become a master. I subscribe to the idea that it is more like 10,000 hours plus or minus 10,000 hours. For some poeple, improvement comes easy and for others improvement is a slow, gradual process. Nonetheless, in both cases dedicated practice to some extent is needed for improvement. What is dedicated practice and how can we apply it to table tennis? Dedicated practice has four elements:</p>
			        <p>1. What you are practicing can be repeated alot</p>
			  		<p>2. Feedback on results is continuously available</p>
			        <p>3. It is highly demanding mentally</p>
			        <p>4. It isn't much fun</p>
			        <p>The first element is fairly self-explanatory and most people are familiar with practicing something (such as a forehand stroke) a few times repeatedly. The second point refers to a few things when it comes to table tennis. You must have feedback at all times while you practice in order to know if you are doing things correctly. If you never know that you are doing something wrong, how will you know that you need to fix it in order to get better? Two immediate forms of feedback are a coach or practice partner and simply watching the ball. Noticing if the ball lands where you want it to or not is a very easy way to know that you are doing something correctly. That can only get you so far though and at lower levels bad technique can still look good if you only watch the ball. This is where coaching comes in. You need someone to watch your technique and tell you where you may be making mistakes. The third element describes the mental state you must be in while practicing. Every time you perform a stroke you must be thinking about what you are currently trying to improve and what bad habits you need to watch out for. Focusing on those things for a full hour training session is not alot of fun, which is what the fourth point is stating. While it may not be fun, it is necessary for improvement. </p>
			        <p>Some examples of ways people practice that are not effective are: hitting the ball randomly with no placement or stroke intent, not having any drills or strokes that you are working on, having no focus while training, not worrying about where the ball lands or how your technique was performed. Watch out for these things in your next training session. My suggestion to get you started is to just focus on one stroke at a time (forehand or backhand) and keep doing it over and over until you can continuously hit the ball where you want. You can check out the <a href="TM.html">external material</a> section of Coloradott for a list of sources that will show you how to perform every stroke in the game with proper technique. Along with that, keep reading these tips of the week as I will go from very basic training concepts and get more and more specific/advanced until I have discussed everything necessary to become a great player!</p>
			        <h3> 3/05/2016 - Training Principles</h3>
			        <p> Today I want to talk about some more basic principles behind training. The main parameters that will affect any training program are frequency, duration, focus, how many drills you practice and quality of feedback. To be more specific, you need to be concerned with many parameters within your training regimen. Frequency means how often you practice. The more often you practice, the faster you will improve. I have seen this in my own training when I take a long vacation. Any time off of table tennis training will decrease your accuracy and will impede your timing. This is because table tennis is a sport which relies on very precise placement of shots (given the small table area). The second principle, duration of practice, deals with how long you practice during a given practice session. An ideal practice session will last between 1-2 hours. This gives you enough time to practice multiple drills (single shot, footwork, match based) while not causing you to lose focus by practicing too much. Split your hour or two into drills using the training guidelines that will be posted on the home page of this website. The focus principle relates to the first tip of the week point #3. You must focus intensively on what you are trying to improve in order to see results. It is also very important to select how many drills you will practice and how long you will practice each one. In my opinion a good length for each drill should be 5 mins if you are very out of shape up to 15 minutes if you are in great shape or really want to work on a certain aspect of your game. On average, 10 minutes per drill should work. This means given an hour training session you can practice three drills and help your partner practice three drills. Given two hours of practice you can obviously practice 5-6 drills each. The quality of feedback parameter is related to the first tip of the week point #2. Feedback from a coach, practice partner or yourself if you are well informed about correct technique is critical to improving your game quickly. You do not want to be performing a stroke incorrectly over an extended period of time. This will create a habit, which will be hard to break later. Instead, you want to perform the stroke correctly from the beginning and create a positive habit that will carry you to the highest levels of play. </p>
			        <p>In summary, next time you practice, my tips are for you to keep practicing a single shot at a time, practice 1-2 hours and as often as possible, stay focused, practice each drill 5-15 minutes and have a system for providing feedback to you regarding your stroke quality. If you do that for multiple training sessions it is guarenteed you will improve. Stay tuned for more tips. Next week I will be talking about the basic table tennis strokes and the importance of mastering them before moving on to more advanced strokes.</p>
