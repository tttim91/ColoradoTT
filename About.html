          <h1> About ColoradoTT (Colorado Table Tennis)</h1>
          <p>ColoradoTT is dedicated to providing you all table tennis related information within Colorado.  This site will be
			continuously updated as information changes and new features will be constantly added.  Upcoming features include player rankings,
			a colorado equipment conduit (way to sell and buy used tables or other equipment), a ColoradoTT league idea, tournament registration and other excellent features! <br />
			<br />
This website was created as a way to let people that live in or are visiting Colorado know about the table tennis clubs, tournaments and leagues available.
			Before this website's creation it was difficult to find all this information (it was mostly spread by word of mouth), but what I was seeing was that many
			people were not getting all the information they needed to find the ideal places to play. Now, ColoradoTT can act as your one stop shop for
			learning about all places to play and all upcoming events related to table tennis!  It will also provide news, which will convert the current state
			of table tennis in the state from just playing a game to a real sporting experience! <br />
            <br />
Table Tennis is one of the greatest sports ever created and one of the most fun and rewarding to play!  This is because while it is extremely simple to begin
			and start playing with your friends it is also extremely difficult to master.  It is a great sport for brain development, exercise and even learning
			about yourself! Being an individual sport it teaches one how to succeed in life without relying on others! I'll let you in on something I have noticed -
			Table Tennis is not much fun to watch if you don't know how the game is played.  You may have noticed top players missing serves or winning a point in one shot.
			This is because table tennis has so many difficult concepts related to it that no other sport has - spin, speed and placement that are all equally important.
			Spin is what truly makes table tennis a unique sport - it is very diffult to see and deal with, which makes table tennis one of the greatest sports for
			challenging yourself! <br />
			<br />
If you want to learn how to play this game well then the only way is to play with other great players and where better to do that than at one of Colorado's great
			table tennis clubs.  These clubs are where top players congregate on a daily basis to play matches, practice technique and have a great time!  Come down to your
			local club and take some lessons or just start playing some games to see what high level table tennis is all about! <br />
			<br />
You will notice at some point that while Colorado has some great clubs, coaches, tournaments and programs, it is lacking in comparison with some other states such
			as California.  There are multiple reasons for this, but I hope this website will be one element that pushes Colorado closer to being one of the
			best states to play table tennis in!  We need people to go to the clubs, we need people to get very involved in training and tournaments surrounding Colorado,
			and we need more table tennis events and hype!  Part of that will be tackled through the use of this website, but some of the responsibility is on YOU to get involved!
		  I hope to see you at one of the local clubs!</p>
